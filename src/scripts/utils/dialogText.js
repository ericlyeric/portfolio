Aside from my keen interest for technology, I enjoy being active (calisthenics, indoor bouldering, and snowboarding). If I'm not coding, or exercising, I like to play the guitar; I enjoy listening most genres of music. For more information about my professional career click on "See Eric's resume" below.`,
