Aside from my keen interest for technology, I enjoy being active (calisthenics, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, ice hockey, bouldering, and snowboarding). If I'm not practicing software spells, or exercising, I like to play the guitar; I enjoy most genres of music. For more information about my professional career click on "See Eric's resume" below.`,
